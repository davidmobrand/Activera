# ACTivera Project Rules

## Authentication & Authorization
- NO REDIRECTS for authentication
  - When user is not logged in, show NotLoggedIn component with login link
  - No automatic redirects to login page
  - Let components handle their own auth state
- Admin Route Protection
  - Admin routes (/admin/*) should check for admin role
  - If not admin, show appropriate message or redirect to dashboard
  - No redirects to login page
- Session Handling
  - Use JWT for session management
  - Session maxAge: 30 days
  - Include user role and ID in session token

## Component Guidelines
