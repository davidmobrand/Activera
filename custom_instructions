# ACTivera Project Rules

## Build and Commit Requirements
- Production Build Check
  - Run `next build` before any commits
  - Fix any TypeScript or linting errors
  - Ensure no build warnings
  - Test the build output
- Commit and Push Process
  - Stage all relevant files
  - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
  - Include affected components in commit description
  - Push to remote after successful build
  - Verify push success

## Build and Commit Workflow
1. Before Committing Changes:
   ```bash
   # Run production build
   npm run build
   ```
   - If build fails, fix errors and repeat
   - If build succeeds, proceed to commit

2. Committing Changes:
   ```bash
   # Stage changes
   git add [modified-files]
   
   # Create descriptive commit
   git commit -m "type: description
   
   - Detail 1
   - Detail 2"
   
   # Push to remote
   git push
   ```

3. After Push:
   - Verify changes on remote
   - Confirm CI/CD pipeline success
   - Document any necessary follow-ups
